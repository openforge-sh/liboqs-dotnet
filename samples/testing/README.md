# Testing Examples

This directory contains testing-related examples for validating OpenForge.Cryptography.LibOqs functionality.

## Examples Included

### Test Vectors
Demonstrates how to validate algorithm implementations against known test vectors and ensure compatibility with other implementations.

### Validation Techniques
- Algorithm consistency checking
- Cross-implementation compatibility testing
- Performance validation
- Error condition testing

## Purpose

These examples help ensure:
- **Correctness**: Your implementation produces expected results
- **Compatibility**: Results match other liboqs implementations
- **Reliability**: Proper error handling and edge case coverage

## Running Examples

```bash
cd testing/
dotnet run
```

Most examples focus on validation techniques rather than complex testing frameworks.
