## About Code Coverage

This report shows the code coverage statistics for the **OpenForge.Cryptography.LibOqs** library, including:

- **Line Coverage** - Percentage of code lines executed during testing
- **Branch Coverage** - Percentage of code branches/paths tested
- **Method Coverage** - Percentage of methods called during testing

The coverage report is generated using tools that analyze which parts of the code are exercised by the test suite, helping identify areas that may need additional testing.
